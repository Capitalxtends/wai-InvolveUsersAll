Involving users early in projects helps you understand real-world
accessibility issues, such as how people with disabilities and older
people use the web with [adaptive strategies](#strategies){:.termref} and
[assistive technologies](#at){:.termref}.

Involving users early helps you implement more effective accessibility
solutions. It also broadens your perspective in a way that can lead you
to discover new ways of thinking about your product that will make it
work better for more people in more situations.

This applies when designing and developing:

-   Websites and web applications
-   Browsers, media players, and assistive technologies
-   Authoring tools such as content management systems (CMS), blog
    software, and WYSIWYG editors
-   Accessibility standards and policies
-   Web technologies and technical specifications, such as HTML

This page gets you started reaping the benefits of **involving users —
specifically people with disabilities and older people with
accessibility needs due to aging — early and throughout different types
of projects**. A separate page focuses on [including users in
evaluation](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/users.html) for web development
projects.

How Involving Users Early Helps {#why}
---------------------------------------

Involving users early in web projects results in better
products for users, more efficient development, and other benefits to
project stakeholders.

### **Better Accessibility and Better Usability** for All Users

When developers understand accessibility issues, they can implement
**more effective** accessibility solutions; for example, their website
will work better and be more usable for people with disabilities, older
users, and [other target
groups](http://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/soc#groups). Making websites and web
tools more usable for people with a range of disabilities improves
general usability for everybody, including people *without*
disabilities. (You could say that involving users with disabilities in
your development project gives you **improved usability** for free.)

This benefits not only users, but also stakeholders; for example, when
websites get [increased
use](http://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/fin.html#increase-use) and other
[business benefits](http://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/) from increased
accessibility.

### More Efficient Development

Including users in the development process helps you **more efficiently
develop** accessible products that work well for real users in real
situations, thus [maximizing your return on investment
(ROI)](http://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/) in accessibility.

When you understand how people use the web and your particular product,
you can:

-   plan accessibility into appropriate project phases from the
    beginning
-   more quickly develop accessibility solutions
-   make informed decisions between different options, avoid wasting
    time guessing
-   limit having to go back and fix problems
-   avoid having to make compromises later because you waited too long
    to address accessibility
-   have a better perspective on accessibility standards, guidelines,
    and other requirements (which you might need to meet now or later,
    for example, if you sell to the government)

All these benefit developers, project managers, and other stakeholders.

### **Motivation**

When designers and developers see people with disabilities use products
like theirs, most are highly motivated by a new understanding of
accessibility. Rather than seeing accessibility as only a checklist
item, the real-life experience shows the human side of accessibility.
Designers and developers get a different level of understanding of the
opportunity for their work to impact lives.

When managers and stakeholders share such experiences of people with
disabilities using their products, it often helps get resources budgeted
and scheduled to address accessibility well.

How to Involve Users throughout Your Project {#range}
------------------------------------------------------

This section focuses on including real people in the process. Note that
accessibility considerations should be addressed even earlier in the
project; really from project inception so that accessibility is
considered early in project planning, budgeting, scheduling, and such.
Accessibility should also be included in your [user-centered design
processes (UCD)](http://www.w3.org/WAI/redesign/ucd) or other design
methodologies and techniques; for example, ensure that the use cases,
user analysis, personas, scenarios, workflows, design walkthroughs, etc.
include people with disabilities and older users.

Below are the basics that you can do yourself to include users in your
projects. If you have the resources, consider getting assistance from
accessibility, disability, and user-centered design specialists.

### Including Users to Understand the Issues

As early as possible in your project:

1.  Learn the basics of [how people with disabilities use the
    web](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web.php) by reading
    online resources and watching videos.
2.  Find people with disabilities, with a range of characteristics. See
    [Getting a Range of Users](#diverse) and [Working with Users](#with)
    below.
3.  Early on, learn about general issues related to what you are
    developing, *e.g., websites, web tools, standards, or other
    products*. Ask people to show you websites or related products that
    work well for them. Then, ask them to show you problems in products
    that do not work well. Ask lots of questions to help you understand
    the accessibility issues.

### Including Users in Implementation

For example, for websites, web applications, and web tools:

4.  When you are considering a specific design aspect, such as
    expanding/collapsing navigation, find other products that are
    already doing it and have users explore with you what works well and
    what does not.
5.  Throughout your design and development, ask users to review
    prototypes. Give them specific tasks to complete and see how the
    different aspects of the design and coding could be improved. Ask
    lots of questions.

For more in this, see [Involving Users in Evaluating Web
Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/users), especially the
sections on [Analyzing Accessibility
Issues](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/users#analyz) and [Drawing
Conclusions and Reporting](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/users#drawing).

### Carefully Consider Input

<mark><strong>Caution:</strong> Carefully consider all input and avoid assuming that input from one person with a disability applies to all people with disabilities.</mark>

A person with a disability does not
necessarily know how other people with the same disability interact with
the web, nor know enough about other disabilities to provide valid
guidance on other accessibility issues. Getting input from a range of
users is best.

Getting a Range of Users {#diverse}
------------------------------------

People with disabilities are as diverse as any people. They have diverse
experiences, expectations, and preferences. They use diverse interaction
techniques, [adaptive strategies](#strategies){:.termref}, and [assistive
technology](#at){:.termref} configurations. People have different
disabilities: auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and
visual — and some have multiple disabilities. Even within one category,
there is extreme variation; for example, "visual disability" includes
people who have been totally blind since birth, people who have
distortion in their central vision from age-related degeneration, and
people who temporarily have blurry vision from an injury or disease.

Include users with a variety of disabilities and [user
characteristics](#userchars){.termref}. Most projects have limited time
and budget and cannot include many different users. Selecting the
optimum number of users with the best suited characteristics can be
difficult. There are resources on the web that provide guidance on
selecting participants with disabilities; for example, [determining
participant characteristics](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/ut_plan.html#characteristics)
and [finding participants with disabilities](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/ut_plan.html#recruiting).

### Users' Experience Interacting with the Web {#experience}

A primary consideration in selecting users is their experience
interacting with the web. For example, some [assistive
technologies](#at){.termref} (AT) are complicated and difficult to
learn. A user with insufficient experience may not know how to use the
AT effectively. On the other hand, a very advanced user might know
uncommon work-arounds to overcome problems in a website that the
"average" user would not be able to handle.

In the early stages when you are first learning how people with
disabilities interact with the web, it is usually best to get people
with a fairly high experience level. ([Involving Users in Evaluating Web
Accessibility](../eval/users) says more about different experience
levels in later evaluation phases.)

Working with Users {#with}
---------------------------

Follow common practices for working with people informally and formally,
for example:

-   Develop appropriate relationships with your users. For example,
    spending time talking informally over lunch may help you work
    together more comfortably.
-   Ensure informed consent and other research ethics. For example,
    participants in studies should be told that they are free to stop at
    any time.
-   Treat people with disabilities and older users with the respect you
    would any other users. For example, respect their time and provide
    appropriate compensation.

There are resources on the web that provide detailed guidance on working
with users; for example, [Interacting with People with
Disabilities](http://uiaccess.com/accessucd/interact.html),
[Assistive Technology and Location](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/involve.html#atloc),
and [The RESPECT Code of Practice](http://www.respectproject.org/code/charm.php?id=).

Combine User Involvement with Standards
------------------------------------------------
{:#stds}

While including users with disabilities and older users with
accessibility needs is key to making your accessibility efforts more
effective and more efficient, that alone cannot address all issues. Even
large projects cannot cover the [diversity](#diverse) of disabilities,
adaptive strategies, and assistive technologies. That is **the role of
accessibility standards**.

-   For websites and web applications, using comprehensive standards
    such as [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
    2.0](/WAI/intro/wcag) helps ensure that you address all issues.
    Combine user involvement with [evaluating conformance to
    WCAG](/test-eval/conformance-eval/) to ensure that
    accessibility is provided to users with a range of disabilities and
    situations.
-   For authoring tools such as content management systems (CMS), blog
    software, and WYSIWYG editors, follow [Authoring Tool Accessibility
    Guidelines (ATAG)](/standards/atag/).
-   For browsers, media players, and other 'user agents', follow [User
    Agent Accessibility Guidelines
    (UAAG)](/standards/uaag/).

More Information and Guidance {#fmi}
-------------------------------------

This document briefly addresses a few points of a very complex topic.
Many resources on other aspects of involving users throughout projects
are available on the web, such as:

-   [Involving Users in Evaluating Web
    Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/users.html) provides more
    details on specifically on evaluation with users.
-   [Recommendations - User Empowerment in Standardisation](http://www.usem-net.eu/index.php?Itemid=77&option=com_content)
    links to recommendations for end users, user organizations, and
    others in the standardization process.
-   [Just Ask: Integrating Accessibility Throughout Design](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/overview.html)
    provides detailed guidance on incorporating accessibility throughout
    projects. For example, see [Incorporating Accessibility Early and
    Throughout](http://uiaccess.com/accessucd/early.html).

Terminology {#terms}
---------------------

**adaptive strategies**{#strategies}
:   Adaptive strategies are techniques that people with disabilities use
    to improve interaction with the web, such as increasing the font
    size in a common browser. Adaptive strategies include techniques
    with mainstream browsers or with [assistive
    technologies](#at){.termref}.

**assistive technologies**{:#at}
:   Assistive technologies are software or equipment that people with
    disabilities use to improve interaction with the web, such as
    [**screen readers**]{#screenreader} that read aloud web pages for
    people who cannot read text, **screen magnifiers** for people with
    some types of low vision, and **voice recognition software** and
    **selection switches** for people who cannot use a keyboard or
    mouse.

**user characteristics**{:#userchars}
:   User characteristics typically include things like age, job
    responsibilities, software, hardware, environment (for example,
    home, shared office, private office, shared public terminal),
    computer experience, and web experience.User characteristics can
    also include type of disability, [adaptive
    strategies](#strategies){.termref} used, and experience with
    specific [assistive technologies](#at){.termref}.

**web content**{:#content}
:   Web "content" generally refers to the information in a web page or
    web application, including text, images, forms, sounds, and such.
    More specific definitions are available in the WCAG documents, which
    are linked from the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
    Overview](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag).
